# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: 'this' is an object

  Researched answer: The JavaScript 'this' keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where is used:
  In a method, 'this' refers to the global object.
  Alone, 'this' refers to the global object.
  In a function 'this' refers to the global object. In strict mode 'this' is undefined.
  In an event, 'this' refers to the element that received the event.




2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a javascript library created by facebook to handle scalability.

  Researched answer: React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is an open-source, component-based front-end JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications.  It is used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. ...React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: Render

4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX a modern form of javascript that incorporates HTML.

  Researched answer: JSX is an inline markup that looks like HTML and gets transformed to JavaScript.

5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: a package handler

  Researched answer: Yarn is a new package manager that replaces the existing workflow for the npm client or other package managers while remaining compatible with the npm registry. It has the same feature set as existing workflows while operating faster, more securely, and more reliably.


6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: My guess is an anonymous means an unknown, standalone function

  Researched answer: Anonymous Function is a function that does not have any name associated with it. Normally we use the function keyword before the function name to define a function in JavaScript, however, in anonymous functions in JavaScript, we use only the function keyword without the function name.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

2. Props:The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.
A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

3. JavaScript Events:  HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.
An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
Here are some examples of HTML events:
An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked

4. Object-oriented programming:  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

5. Ruby:A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.
